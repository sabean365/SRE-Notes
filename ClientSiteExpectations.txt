MANAGER FEEDBACK: What would you do if the manager said...
	"Having trouble approaching the task. Does not know how much info they are picking up." 
		Speak to the manager and ask questions about what they can do.
		Write down the answers if they are giving them to you.
		Put in clean, good efforts -- self-assessment is always a good thing.
		If that's true, do your own research to find a way to be more effective.
	
	"Only committing to the minimum, not taking on challenging tasks."
		Ask if there is more you can do or if you can help someone else.
		Offer to do more advanced projects if the opportunity comes up.
	
	"Wants them to ask more questions and speak up. Don't be shy, voice opinions or ask questions in meetings."
		Prepare and practice your questions ahead of time; write down the questions so you are not too nervous to speak.
		Work your way into being comfortable.
