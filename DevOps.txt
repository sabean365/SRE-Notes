DevOps

Site Reliability Engineering
	
	business requirement -> analyze -> coding
	
	Development			<---------->	Operation
	
	Developer -> App					Operate and maintain the application
	
															load balance
													
	Domain -> host						Server1 - host application			Server2 - host 
												  operate and maintain				  second copy of code
												  the application
												  AWS
	
										Deploy the updated code
	
	Context: Launching a new feature vs reliability
	Product Teams want to move fast
		Deploy as many features as possible
		Deploy as fast as possible
	Reliability Teams want to be stable
		Focus on reliability
		Break as little as possible
		
		
	DevOps is a collaboration between Development and IT Operations to make software production and deploymnet in an automated and repeatable way

	Development - Teamwork and Innovation
	
		++
	Ops  - Automation and Collaboration

WHY DevOps?
	Combination of Technology, Process and Culture
	
	
DevOps Models
	Left to Right Approach - Developer -> GIT -> Build Code/Unit Testing -> Artifacts -> Dev -> QA Test -> Pre-Production -> Production
	Right to Left approach -> continuous feedback from end user perspective
	Continuous Learning and Experimentation
	
Continuous Integration in DevOps - check in once a day

Continuous Deployment - putting all changes to production environmnet making sure changes are free from errors and sustainable -> high quality

Continuous Delivery - system that facilitates you to make continuous deployment

Cloud - go global in minutes

DevOps solves
CI and CD - 3 ways
Infrastructure Automation
Managing the relationship between Dev and Operations
Failing intelligently

Kubernetes
Ansible
Bash
Management


GIT - manage collaboration of software development
Linux - Everything is Linux
Ansible - automate tasks with operation infrastructure
Terraform - deploy automation in public cloud
Docker/Kubernetes Deploying Cloud
Python - scripting
Jenkins - build and deploy code
Grafana and ELK ensure operations are funning smoothly
