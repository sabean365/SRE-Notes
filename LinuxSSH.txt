SSH - encrypted tunnel

authorized_keys
contains a list of public keys of users who will need to use RSA
each key must be written on one line
authorized keys must have permissions: chmod 600

/etc/ssh/sshd_config -> 'd' is for server
 
SSH behavior:  ONLY USE RSA keys to connect is MOST SECURE
default port number is 22
login restrictions for root and others: root denied -> declaration: "PermitRootLogin no"
usage of RSA keys or not: set up -> "PubkeyAuthientication yes" and "AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys"
password use or not: do not for others but for restricted list, including sysadmins -> "PasswordAuthentication no"
allow empty passwords or not: NOT
whitelists -> NOT DEFAULT -> heightened security level
separated configurations per user? OR
separated configurations per service type?


sshd_config will check for keys in /home/[username]/.ssh of client
on server, will go /home/[username]/.ssh/authorized_keys

Whitelist:
AllowUsers stu2022


Match User student #
	some-personalized-SSH-directives
	
Match Group [groupname] #

Example:
User jack exceptionally can use password or connect

PasswordAuthentication no
Match User jack
	PasswordAuthentication yes
	
	
should make a copy of original sshd_config file in case you make a mistake

each modification done requires that the SSH be restarted:

	systemctl restart sshd
	
SSH 
	-> SFTP file transfer protocol
	utilization:
		sftp remoteuser@remotehost + standard fTP directives 
		
	-> SCP seccure copy protocol
	utilization:
		scp locuser@lochost:/local/file   remoteuser@remotehost:/remote/file

	
	 /home/u_client/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	 
	 ssh u_client@localhost
	 ssh u_server@localhost
	 
	 to go into log file from root: cd /var/log -> vi secure
	 
	 cp /home/u_client_1/.ssh/id_rsa* .
	 chown (change ownership) u_client_2. id_rsa*
