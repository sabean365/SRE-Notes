Modules vs Modularization
When using modules or developing modules, we use a single file main.tf, outputs.tf, variables.tf etc.
but outside of modules, like we're working now, use modularization-- otherwise it'll be very difficult to spot errors and fix them in a huuuuggggeeee file

NAT
-> NAT gateway provides outbound internet connectivity for one or more subnets of a virtual network. 
-> Once NAT gateway is associated to a subnet, NAT provides source network address translation (SNAT) for that subnet. 
-> NAT gateway specifies which static IP addresses virtual machines use when creating outbound flows.

Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS): lets you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule.
Terraform:  open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services.
Azure DevOps (ADO):  tools and services like for example Repos, Pipelines, Boards and others that help teams to collaborate, develop, build and test.
Azure Pipeline Agents:  used to build your code, execute scripts or deploy your software. An agent is computing infrastructure using Windows, MacOS or Linux with installed agent software that runs one job at a time.
